🧩 Zephyr for Jira – Test Management in Agile Teams
📖 Overview

Zephyr for Jira
 (also known as Zephyr Squad) is a test management solution built directly inside Jira.

It allows QA and development teams to create, manage, execute, and track test cases without leaving the Jira environment, ensuring testing stays aligned with agile workflows.

✨ Key Features

✅ Test Case Management – Create and organize test cases within Jira projects.
✅ Test Cycles – Group test cases into structured cycles for organized execution.
✅ Test Execution Tracking – Mark results as Pass or Fail and monitor progress in real time.
✅ Reports & Metrics – Access dashboards and reports to measure quality trends.

🧪 Test Cycle & Execution Analysis

Zephyr emphasizes cycle-based test execution, where test results directly impact overall cycle status:

🔴 Single Point of Failure – If any step in a test case fails, the entire test case fails.

🔴 Test Cycle Fail – If any test case in a cycle fails, the entire cycle is marked as failed.

✅ Test Cycle Pass – If all test cases pass, the cycle passes successfully.

📊 Examples
✅ Passed Test Cycle

1 test case with all steps passing → Test Case = Pass, Cycle = Pass

2 test cases where both pass → Cycle = Pass

❌ Failed Test Cycle

1 test case with 3 steps pass + 1 step fail → Test Case = Fail, Cycle = Fail

2 test cases where one passes, one fails → Cycle = Fail

2 test cases where both fail → Cycle = Fail
